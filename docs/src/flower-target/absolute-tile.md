![image](../screenshots/flower-target-absolute-tile.png)

This will cast the `Lyliac Plant` spell on a tile at a specific location on the map, regardless of the character's current position.
This will restore the mana of the character standing on the tile.

**NOTE:** You must be within visible range of the tile for the spell to be cast.

## Options

- `Absolute Tile` - the tile on the map to cast flower on. It is **not** relative to your character's current position.
- `Mouse Offset X/Y` - offsets the mouse screen coordinates by the specified amount.
- `Flower Interval` - the time interval between casting flower on the same tile location.

**NOTE:** The `Flower Threshold` option is not available for this target type.

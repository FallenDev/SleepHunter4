# Relative Tile Flower

![image](../screenshots/flower-target-relative-tile.png)

This will cast the `Lyliac Plant` spell on a tile relative to the character's current position.
For example, "2 Left, 1 Down" would be the tile located 2 tiles left and 1 tile down of your character's current position.

This relative tile will be preserved even if the character moves to a different tile.

## Options

- `Relative Tile` - the tile relative to your character's current position.
- `Mouse Offset X/Y` - offsets the mouse screen coordinates by the specified amount.
- `Flower Interval` - the time interval between casting flower on the same tile location.

**NOTE:** The `Flower Threshold` option is not available for this target type.

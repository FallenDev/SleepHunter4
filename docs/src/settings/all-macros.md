# All Macro Settings

![image](../screenshots/settings-all-macros.png)

The `All Macros` settings tab contains settings for all macros, both skills and spells.

## Action on Map Change

This setting determines what happens when the character changes maps.
By default, this is `Stop Macro`.

This is typically used to automatically stop macroing when the character leaves the Dojo.

## Action on X/Y Change

This setting determines what happens when the character changes X/Y coordinates.
By default, this is `Continue Macro`.

This is typically used to automatically stop macroing when the character is thrown or otherwise moved.

## Medenia Panel Switching

This setting determines how the Medenia panel switching feature should be used within the game client.
By default, this is `Shift-Click`.

If you have a different in-game setting, you can change this to match.

## Preserve Selected Panel

This setting determines whether the currently selected panel in the game client should be preserved while macroing.
By default, this is `Enabled`.

For example, if the chat window is up it will be set back to that while macroing to avoid having to click on it again.

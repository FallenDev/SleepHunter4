![image](../screenshots/settings-game-client.png)

The `Game Client` settings tab contains settings for the Dark Ages game client.

## Client Path

This setting determines the path to the Dark Ages game client executable.
It is also used to determine the path to the Dark Ages game client data files for rendering icons.

## Client Version

This setting determines the version of the Dark Ages game client and how any runtime patches should be applied.
The default is `Auto-Detect` and will automatically detect the version of the Dark Ages game client based on the client signature.

You should not change this unless you are using a custom Dark Ages game client.

## Allow Multiple Instances

This setting determines when the "multiple instances" patch should be applied when the Dark Ages game client is started.
By default, this is `Enabled`.

## Skip Intro Video

This setting determines when the "skip intro video" patch should be applied when the Dark Ages game client is started.
By default, this is `Enabled`.

## No Foreground Walls

This setting determines when the "no foreground walls" patch should be applied when the Dark Ages game client is started.
By default, this is `Disabled`.

This is useful when trying to find items that are hidden behind walls.

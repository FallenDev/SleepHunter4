# Debug Settings

![image](../screenshots/settings-debug.png)

The `Debug` settings tab contains settings for debugging the application, not intended for normal use.

## Show All Game Processes

This setting determines whether the application will show all running Dark Ages clients, including those that are not logged into a character.
By default, this is `Disabled`.

This is useful for debugging the application when client instances are not being detected properly.
Typically, this is used with custom Dark Ages clients testing client version variations.

## Enable Debug Logging

This setting determines whether the application will write debug logs to the `logs` folder.
By default, this is `Disabled`.

This can be useful for debugging strange behavior in the application.

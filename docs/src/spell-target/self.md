# Self Target

![image](../screenshots/spell-target-self.png)

This will cast the spell on yourself as the target.

The `Mouse Offset X/Y` is used to fine-tune the mouse screen coordinates, if needed.

**NOTE:** The older `Relative Coordinates` target type has been replaced with this new `Offset X/Y` target type on `Self`, as it was redundant.

## Options

- `Mouse Offset X/Y` - offsets the mouse screen coordinates by the specified amount.
- `Cast Spell Until Reaches` - sets the maximum level before this spell will no longer be cast in the [Spell Queue](../user-interface/main-window.md#spell-queue).

This is used when a spell does not require a target, such as a self-only or group spell.

**NOTE:** This option cannot be selected, it is automatically selected when the spell does not require a target.

## Options

- `Cast Spell Until Reaches` - sets the maximum level before this spell will no longer be cast in the [Spell Queue](../user-interface/main-window.md#spell-queue).

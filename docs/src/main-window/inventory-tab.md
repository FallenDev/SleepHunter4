# Inventory Tab

Inventory items are arranged as a grid of icon buttons similar to the game client, displaying the name of the item.

## Grid Layout

By default, items are arranged with 12 items per row.
You can change the number of items displayed per row in the [Settings](../settings.md) window.

The character's gold will be displayed in the last slot.

## Tooltip Help

You can mouse over an item to see the tooltip for that item.

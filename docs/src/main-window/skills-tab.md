# Skills Tab

![image](../screenshots/skills-tab.png)

Skills are arranged as a grid of icon buttons similar to the game client, displaying the current level of the skill and the cooldown status (if on cooldown).

## Skill Organization

Skills are organized into 3 tabs:

- `Temuair` - skills learned from your original class path
- `Medenia` - skills learned from your Medenian class path
- `World` - skills learned for world-related activities (`Look`, `Swimming`, etc.)

## Toggling Skills

Double-clicking a skill will toggle it on or off for macroing.
When a skill is "enabled" for macroing, the icon will be highlighted white and a thick border will be displayed around the skill.

## Cooldown Display

When a skill is on cooldown it will be shaded the theme color to indicate that it is not available for use.

## Grid Layout

By default, skills are arranged with 12 skills per row.
You can change the number of skills displayed per row in the [Settings](../settings.md) window.

## Tooltip Help

You can mouse over a skill to see the tooltip for that skill.

## Additional Settings

Additional settings for the `Skills` tab can be found in the [Skill Macros Settings](../settings/skill-macros.md) window.

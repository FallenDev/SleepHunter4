# Features Tab

Client-specific features that are enabled via feature flags will be displayed here.

These are defined in the Client Version definitions under `FeatureFlags` section.

**NOTE:** If there are no **Enabled** features for a client, this tab will **not** be displayed!

## Tooltip Help

You can mouse over an option to see the tooltip for that feature flag.
